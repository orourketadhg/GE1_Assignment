# Project Title

Name: Tadhg O'Rourke

Student Number: C17403574

Class Group: DT228

# Description of the project

This project shows a procedurally animated creature walking, via Inverse Kinematics, along a path created by a Bezier Curve Editor. This project will also showcase the use of Unity's (New) Input System to track user input.   

# Instructions for use

## Play Mode:
  [spacebar] - Cycle to next camera position <br/>
  [W/S] - Increase/Decrease Walking speed <br/>
  [Up Arrow/Down Arrow] - Increase/Decrease Walking speed <br/>
  
## Editor Mode:
  ### Path GameObject
  [Right Click] - Move/Adjust Anchor/Control point <br/>
  [Shift + Right Click] - Split Segment <br/>

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

I am most proud of the fact that I used a advanced tutorial, with help from a Inverse Kinematics tutorial, to create a completely prodedual walking animation. I am also proud of the use of Unitys (New) input system to handle any user input recieved by the player gives. 

# Proposal submitted earlier can go here:

The following project outlines a procedurally animated creature walking over a infinite winding path. The path will generate using a Bizier curve to construct the ground the creature will follow. I plan to use Unity3D's new Input System to control the camera, the colors, and the creatures speed.
